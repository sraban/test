- Tye assertion must be `as Type`, not Allowed <type>
- return value of function must match with declared type
- interface must start with `I`
- private mebers start with `_`
- Accessibility of member of class must be set
- specify the collation of class members on pririty
  static -> instance
  field -> consructor -> method
  public -> protected -> private
- Array COnstrctor is forbidden
- delete passed in key is disabled
- empty fun are not allowed
- forbidden to use an empty interface
- prohibitted to use any
- disallow redundant non-nukk assertions
- Promise exception must be handled
- prohibit the us of for in loops
- forbidden to dfeine in interface constrictor , or define in class new
- define external namespace usinf `declare namespace fool {}`
- prohibit use of require rather use import
- forbid `this` assigning to other variables, exprect by destructuring assignment
- public meethod must define the types of input and output parmeters
- unnecessary apprearnace of constructor() is prohibited 
- use includes instead of indexOf()
- use optional chaining alternative &&
   foo1 && foo1.a && foo1.a.b && foo1.a.b.c
   (foo1?.a?.b?.c)
- constructor they must be set to readonly

# Pthon Rules:

- readability, maintainability, security, relliability, testability, efficiency and portability ---> codes are systematic, easy to use and easy to use
- isinsatance()
- when copmparing with None use `is, is not`
- if a lambad expression occupies more than one line, use a def statement
- compression and generator expressoins
- method override should not change contract
- Magic functions must return NotImplemented
- dont use `return break continue` staments or `throw exceptoins` in the finaly block
- donot use tempfile.mktemp() to create temprary files
- don't use eval() or exec() to execute untrusted code
- dont directly use external data to concate sql statements
- don't use .format()
- don't driectly use external data to concatenate SQL statements
- - don't use .format() to format untrusted external data
- prevent ReDoS
- don't log sensitive data such as pwd and keys
- in memeory-sensitive scenarios, use a generator comprehension rahther than list compression
